ENHANCED SHUFFLE MODE - Additional logging and error handling improvements:

1. Add activity count validation on init
2. Add detailed console logging for debugging
3. Add fallback error messages
4. Ensure Fisher-Yates shuffle is working correctly
5. Add progress indicator showing X of Y activities

These changes have already been implemented in the existing shuffle-mode.js file.
The shuffle algorithm is correct and should work properly once activities are loaded.
