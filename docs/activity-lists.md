## Icon TODO List

All activities need icons added. The icon field in `data/activities.json` is currently empty for all items.

**Designer/Developer Task:**
- Add appropriate icon paths or SVG references to each activity's `icon` field
- Icons should be simple, clear, and work well at small sizes
- Maintain consistent visual style across all icons
- Consider accessibility (icons should supplement text, not replace it)

## Usage Guidelines

### For Developers
- Always use `data/activities.json` as the source of truth
- Do not hardcode activity lists in code
- The app should dynamically load and display these activities
- Maintain 3rd-grade reading level for any new additions

### For Content Writers
- Keep language simple, direct, and action-oriented
- Use short sentences (max 10-12 words)
- Avoid jargon or complex vocabulary
- Test readability if making changes

### For Designers
- Icons should be intuitive and immediately recognizable
- Use consistent color palette matching mode colors
- Ensure sufficient contrast for accessibility
- Test icons at actual display size

## Updates and Maintenance

To add or modify activities:

1. Edit `data/activities.json`
2. Update this documentation to match
3. Test in the app to ensure proper display
4. Run accessibility checks
5. Update version notes if significant changes
